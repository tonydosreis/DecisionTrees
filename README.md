# DecisionTrees

Currently:
- Includes tokenizer
- Includes kfold cross validation
- Supports classification only
- Supports discrete inputs only
- Supports determinstic relations only
- Overfitts 

To do:
- Include post pruning to fix overfitting
- Include pre pruning to fix overfitting
- Support non-deterministic relations (easy to implement, deal with situations where attr_list is empty but entropy is not zero)
- Support continuous inputs
- Support regression
