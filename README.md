# DecisionTrees

Currently:
- Includes tokenizer
- Includes kfold cross validation
- Supports classification only
- Supports discrete inputs only
- Supports determinstic relations only
- Overfitts 

To do
-Include post pruning to fix overfitting
-Include pre pruning to fix overfitting
-Support non-deterministic relations (easy to implement, deal with situations where attr_list is empty but entropy is not zero)
-Support continuous inputs
-Support regression
